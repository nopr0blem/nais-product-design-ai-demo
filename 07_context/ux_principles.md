# UX Principles — NAIS / Libellia / Studio

1. Cognitive load reduction over feature richness
2. Prioritize signal clarity over data exhaustiveness
3. Default views must work without configuration
4. Pediatric workflows must not be adapted adult workflows
5. Visual hierarchy reflects clinical priority
6. Progressive disclosure over dense screens

When evaluating solutions:
- Ask "what does the user understand in 5 seconds?"
- Avoid adding steps to critical paths

# Insight Pack: NAIS Platform User Signals (Libellia FR, Studio IT)

## 1. Key Insights

### 1.1. Difficulty Assessing Patient Status at a Glance
- Pediatricians on Libellia (FR) report that the patient summary does not allow them to quickly determine if a child is well or not. This impedes rapid clinical assessment during dossier opening.  
  - **Reference:** [sig_2026_02_03_001]  
  - **Severity:** High

### 1.2. Cognitive Overload from Excessive Information
- General practitioners on Libellia (FR) feel overwhelmed by the volume of information displayed, expressing a need for important alerts to be more prominent during consultations.  
  - **Reference:** [sig_2026_02_03_002]  
  - **Severity:** Medium

### 1.3. Lack of Prioritization of Clinical Information
- Both pediatricians and general practitioners on Studio (IT) find that key clinical information is not immediately visible during first visits or in patient records, slowing down their workflow.  
  - **References:** [sig_2026_02_03_003], [sig_2026_02_03_004]  
  - **Severity:** High (first visit), Low (navigation speed)

### 1.4. Pediatric Data Not Sufficiently Highlighted
- On Libellia (FR), pediatricians note that growth curves and percentiles are present but not visible enough in the patient summary, limiting their utility in child follow-up.  
  - **Reference:** [sig_2026_02_03_005]  
  - **Severity:** High

### 1.5. Lack of Contextualization in Patient View
- General practitioners on Libellia (FR) report that the patient view does not adapt to patient age or context, reducing relevance and efficiency.  
  - **Reference:** [sig_2026_02_03_006]  
  - **Severity:** Medium

### 1.6. Vaccination Information Not Easily Identifiable

## 2. Synthesis & Recommendations

- **Highlight Critical Data:** Both platforms need to improve the visibility and prioritization of critical clinical information (e.g., alerts, growth curves, vaccinations) in patient summaries and first-visit screens. ([sig_2026_02_03_001], [sig_2026_02_03_002], [sig_2026_02_03_003], [sig_2026_02_03_005], [sig_2026_02_03_007])
- **Contextualize Patient Views:** Adapting patient views based on age and clinical context could reduce cognitive load and increase relevance for clinicians. ([sig_2026_02_03_006])
- **Reduce Cognitive Overload:** Streamline information presentation to surface key alerts and minimize non-essential data during critical workflows. ([sig_2026_02_03_002], [sig_2026_02_03_004])

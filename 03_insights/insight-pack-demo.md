# Insight Pack: Pediatric User Experience — NAIS Platform (Libellia FR)

## 1. Immediate Child Status Clarity is Lacking
- Pediatricians report difficulty in rapidly assessing a child's health status upon dossier opening. The current synthesis does not provide an at-a-glance understanding of whether the child is well or not.  
  **Evidence:** [sig_2026_02_03_001]  
  **Implication:** The patient summary must prioritize a clear, immediate health status indicator.

## 2. Critical Pediatric Data (Growth, Percentiles) Not Prominent
- Key pediatric metrics such as growth curves and percentiles are present but insufficiently visible in the patient synthesis, reducing their practical value during consultations.  
  **Evidence:** [sig_2026_02_03_005]  
  **Implication:** Growth and percentile data should be visually emphasized and accessible at first glance.

## 3. Cognitive Load from Information Overload
- Users experience high cognitive load due to excessive information display, making it difficult to focus on critical alerts and signals.  
  **Evidence:** [sig_2026_02_03_002]  
  **Implication:** Information hierarchy must be improved, with alerts and priority data surfaced above less critical details.

## 4. Lack of Contextualization by Age or Clinical Context
- The patient view is uniform regardless of patient age or clinical scenario, failing to adapt to pediatric-specific needs.  
  **Evidence:** [sig_2026_02_03_006]  
  **Implication:** Patient views should be context-aware, adapting content and emphasis based on age and consultation type.

## 5. Vaccination Information Not Immediately Distinguishable
- Vaccination status is not visually distinct, making it harder for clinicians to quickly verify immunization during routine checks.  
  **Evidence:** [sig_2026_02_03_007]  
  **Implication:** Vaccination data should be visually separated and highlighted within the patient summary.

### Synthesis for Product Management

- **Prioritize visual synthesis** of child status, growth, and vaccination in the patient summary.
- **Reduce cognitive load** by decluttering and surfacing only the most relevant pediatric signals.
- **Implement context-aware views** that adapt to patient age and consultation type, in line with pediatric workflow needs.
- **Aligns with market context:** These insights reinforce the need for information prioritization, visual clarity, and minimal configuration, as demanded by French pediatricians and regulatory context.

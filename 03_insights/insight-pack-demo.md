## 1. Immediate Clinical Status Not Evident for Pediatric Patients
- Pediatricians in France report difficulty in rapidly assessing a child's health status upon dossier opening. The current patient summary does not provide an at-a-glance understanding of whether the child is well or not. [sig_2026_02_03_001]
- This aligns with the market context emphasizing the need for immediate understanding and information prioritization for pediatricians.

**Implication:**  
Redesign the patient summary to visually synthesize key pediatric signals (growth, development, vaccination) for rapid assessment.

## 2. Cognitive Overload Due to Excessive, Non-Prioritized Information
- General practitioners in France feel overwhelmed by the volume of information displayed, seeking primarily critical alerts. [sig_2026_02_03_002]
- Italian pediatricians echo this, noting that clinically prioritized information is not immediately visible during first visits. [sig_2026_02_03_003]
- Italian general practitioners suggest that highlighting key information would further speed up navigation. [sig_2026_02_03_004]

**Implication:**  
Implement clear visual prioritization of critical alerts and key clinical data to reduce cognitive load and improve consultation efficiency.

---

## 3. Pediatric Data (Growth Curves, Percentiles) Insufficiently Highlighted
- French pediatricians state that growth curves and percentiles are present but not visible enough in the patient synthesis. [sig_2026_02_03_005]

**Implication:**  
Make pediatric growth and development indicators more prominent in the patient summary, in line with user expectations and regulatory context.

---

## 4. Lack of Contextualization in Patient View
- French generalists note that the patient view is generic and does not adapt to patient age or consultation context. [sig_2026_02_03_006]

**Implication:**  
Introduce contextual adaptation in the patient view (e.g., pediatric vs. adult, acute vs. routine visit) to surface the most relevant information.

---

## 5. Vaccination Information Not Sufficiently Distinct
- Italian pediatricians report that vaccination data is not immediately distinguishable from other information during periodic checks. [sig_2026_02_03_007]

**Implication:**  
Visually differentiate vaccination status and alerts within the patient summary to support quick identification and action.

---

## Synthesis & Recommendations

- Prioritize visual synthesis of key pediatric signals (growth, development, vaccination) in the patient summary. [sig_2026_02_03_001, sig_2026_02_03_005, sig_2026_02_03_007]
- Reduce cognitive load by surfacing critical alerts and clinically prioritized information. [sig_2026_02_03_002, sig_2026_02_03_003, sig_2026_02_03_004]
- Contextualize patient views based on age and consultation type. [sig_2026_02_03_006]
- Avoid over-configurability; focus on stability and clarity, as per market context.

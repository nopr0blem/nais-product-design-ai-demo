### 1. Patient Summary Visibility

- **Products:** Libellia, Studio
- **Count:** 5
- **Severity (max):** high
- **Evidence IDs:** sig_2026_02_03_001, sig_2026_02_03_002, sig_2026_02_03_101, sig_2026_02_03_102, sig_2026_02_04_001
- **Verbatims:**
  - "Impossible to see key child info at a glance."
  - "Sintesi paziente non immediatamente visibile nella visita."
- **Interpretation:** Both French and Italian users report that the pediatric patient summary is not sufficiently visible or accessible, causing delays and increasing cognitive load during consultations. This is a critical, cross-country issue affecting clinical efficiency and user satisfaction.
- **Normalization notes:** Merged FR 'synthese_patient' and IT 'sintesi_paziente' as both refer to pediatric patient summary visibility.

### 2. Pediatric Data Prominence

- **Products:** Libellia
- **Count:** 4
- **Severity (max):** high
- **Evidence IDs:** sig_2026_02_03_005, sig_2026_02_03_006, sig_2026_02_04_003, sig_2026_02_03_002
- **Verbatims:**
  - "Courbes et vaccins noyés dans les autres données."
  - "Données pédiatriques pas en avant dans la synthèse."
- **Interpretation:** French pediatricians find that critical pediatric data (growth, development, vaccinations) are not sufficiently prominent in the patient summary, contradicting clinical priorities and increasing the risk of oversight.
- **Normalization notes:** Grouped 'donnees_pediatriques' signals focused on visibility/prominence of pediatric data.

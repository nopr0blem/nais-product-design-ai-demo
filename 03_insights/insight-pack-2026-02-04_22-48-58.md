# Insight Analysis (Context-aware)

## 1) Executive Summary

- Both Libellia FR and Studio IT users report difficulty rapidly understanding pediatric patient status due to insufficiently prioritized synthesis views ([sig_2026_02_03_001], [sig_2026_02_03_002], [sig_2026_02_03_101]).
- Pediatric data (growth curves, percentiles) are not immediately visible or prioritized, especially in Libellia, leading to high-severity frustration ([sig_2026_02_03_005], [sig_2026_02_03_006], [sig_2026_02_04_003]).
- Cognitive overload from excessive or poorly organized information is a recurring pain point, particularly for generalists in Libellia ([sig_2026_02_03_003], [sig_2026_02_04_002]).
- Clinical alerts and vaccination status are not sufficiently prominent in both products, risking missed critical information ([sig_2026_02_04_019], [sig_2026_02_04_020], [sig_2026_02_03_007]).
- Workflow guidance and performance issues are secondary but notable themes, with users in both markets requesting clearer consultation flows and reporting occasional slowness ([sig_2026_02_04_013], [sig_2026_02_04_014], [sig_2026_02_04_015], [sig_2026_02_04_016]).

### 1. Pediatric synthesis visibility

- Products: Both
- Count: 6
- Severity (max): high
- Evidence IDs: [sig_2026_02_03_001, sig_2026_02_03_002, sig_2026_02_03_101, sig_2026_02_03_102, sig_2026_02_04_001, sig_2026_02_03_005]
- Representative verbatims:
    - "Je ne comprends pas en quelques secondes si l’enfant va bien ou non."
    - "Non vedo subito se il bambino ha problemi clinici rilevanti."
- Interpretation: Across both Libellia and Studio, users (especially pediatricians) cannot quickly assess a child’s health status from the synthesis view. Key pediatric signals are not surfaced, and the synthesis is often too similar to adult views, requiring extra clicks or mental effort to find relevant information.
- Notes on normalization: Merged "synthese_patient" (FR) and "sintesi_paziente" (IT) as both refer to the pediatric synthesis view.

### 2. Pediatric data prioritization

- Products: Libellia
- Count: 4
- Severity (max): high
- Evidence IDs: [sig_2026_02_03_005, sig_2026_02_03_006, sig_2026_02_04_003, sig_2026_02_03_006]
- Representative verbatims:
    - "Les courbes et percentiles sont présents mais pas visibles au premier coup d’œil."
    - "Les données de croissance devraient être prioritaires dans la vue patient."
- Interpretation: In Libellia, pediatricians expect growth curves and percentiles to be immediately visible and prioritized in the patient view. Their current placement requires scrolling or extra actions, which is seen as a critical flaw for pediatric follow-up.

---

### 3. Cognitive overload

- Products: Libellia
- Count: 2
- Severity (max): medium
- Evidence IDs: [sig_2026_02_03_003, sig_2026_02_04_002]
- Representative verbatims:
    - "Il y a trop d’informations affichées par défaut, je dois trier mentalement."
    - "J’ai trop de sections ouvertes, je voudrais une vue plus simple par défaut."
- Interpretation: Generalists in Libellia report that the default patient view presents too much information, increasing cognitive load and forcing them to mentally filter for relevant data. There is a clear demand for a simpler, more focused default view.

---

### 4. Clinical alerts visibility

- Products: Both
- Count: 2
- Severity (max): medium
- Evidence IDs: [sig_2026_02_04_019, sig_2026_02_04_020]
- Representative verbatims:
    - "Je voudrais des alertes plus visibles (allergies, traitements en cours)."
    - "Servirebbero avvisi più visibili per allergie e terapie in corso."
- Interpretation: Both French and Italian users want clinical alerts (e.g., allergies, ongoing treatments) to be much more visually prominent in the patient record, indicating a cross-market need for improved alert signaling.

- Notes on normalization: "alertes_cliniques" (FR) and "avvisi_clinici" (IT) normalized as both refer to clinical alerts visibility.

---

### 5. Vaccination status visibility

- Products: Libellia
- Count: 2
- Severity (max): medium
- Evidence IDs: [sig_2026_02_03_007, sig_2026_02_04_004]
- Representative verbatims:
    - "Je dois scroller pour savoir si les vaccins sont à jour."
    - "Je ne vois pas immédiatement les vaccins en retard."
- Interpretation: In Libellia, vaccination status is not immediately accessible, requiring scrolling or extra effort. Pediatricians expect overdue or missing vaccinations to be instantly visible in the patient view.

## 3) Platform / Common opportunities (NAIS)

1. **Improve pediatric synthesis view clarity (shared component)**
   - Rationale: Both markets report inability to rapidly assess pediatric status ([sig_2026_02_03_001], [sig_2026_02_03_101]).
   - Validation: Prototype a revised synthesis view with prioritized pediatric signals; test 5-second comprehension with both FR and IT users.

2. **Enhance clinical alerts prominence (shared alert widget)**
   - Rationale: Both markets want more visible clinical alerts ([sig_2026_02_04_019], [sig_2026_02_04_020]).
   - Validation: Test alert prominence and discoverability in simulated patient records.

3. **Default view adaptation by patient profile (platform logic)**
   - Rationale: Both markets note insufficient adaptation of views to pediatric vs. adult context ([sig_2026_02_03_201], [sig_2026_02_03_202]).
   - Validation: Validate logic for defaulting to pediatric-optimized views without user configuration.

## 4) Libellia FR-specific opportunities

1. **Prioritize growth and pediatric data in patient view**
   - Rationale: High-severity signals about growth curves/percentiles not being visible ([sig_2026_02_03_005], [sig_2026_02_04_

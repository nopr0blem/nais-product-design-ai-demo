# Insight Analysis (Context-aware)

## 1) Executive Summary

- Both Libellia FR and Studio IT users report difficulty rapidly understanding pediatric patient status due to insufficiently prioritized synthesis views ([sig_2026_02_03_001], [sig_2026_02_03_002], [sig_2026_02_03_101], [sig_2026_02_04_006]).
- High cognitive load from excessive or poorly filtered information is a recurring pain point across both markets ([sig_2026_02_03_003], [sig_2026_02_03_103], [sig_2026_02_04_002], [sig_2026_02_04_007]).
- Pediatric-specific data (growth curves, percentiles, vaccinations) are not sufficiently visible or prioritized, especially in Libellia FR ([sig_2026_02_03_005], [sig_2026_02_03_006], [sig_2026_02_04_003], [sig_2026_02_03_007], [sig_2026_02_04_004]).
- Clinical prioritization (alerts, critical data) is not clear enough at first glance, particularly during initial or pediatric visits ([sig_2026_02_03_004], [sig_2026_02_03_104], [sig_2026_02_04_010]).
- Both platforms show issues with workflow guidance and navigation, leading to inefficiencies and user frustration ([sig_2026_02_04_013], [sig_2026_02_04_014], [sig_2026_02_04_005], [sig_2026_02_04_009]).

### 1. Pediatric Synthesis Visibility

- Products: Both
- Count: 6
- Severity (max): high
- Evidence IDs: [sig_2026_02_03_001], [sig_2026_02_03_002], [sig_2026_02_03_101], [sig_2026_02_04_001], [sig_2026_02_04_006], [sig_2026_02_03_102]
- Representative verbatims:
    - "Je ne comprends pas en quelques secondes si l’enfant va bien ou non."
    - "Non vedo subito se il bambino ha problemi clinici rilevanti."
- Interpretation: Across both Libellia FR and Studio IT, users cannot quickly assess a pediatric patient's status from the synthesis view. Key pediatric signals are not sufficiently surfaced, leading to uncertainty and inefficiency at dossier/cartella opening. This is a high-frequency, high-severity issue.
- Notes on normalization: Merged "synthese_patient" (FR) and "sintesi_paziente" (IT) under "Pediatric Synthesis Visibility".

### 2. Cognitive Load / Information Overload

- Products: Both
- Count: 6
- Severity (max): medium
- Evidence IDs: [sig_2026_02_03_003], [sig_2026_02_04_002], [sig_2026_02_03_103], [sig_2026_02_04_007], [sig_2026_02_03_004], [sig_2026_02_04_010]
- Representative verbatims:
    - "Il y a trop d’informations affichées par défaut, je dois trier mentalement."
    - "Vorrei una schermata più leggera, con solo ciò che serve."
- Interpretation: Users in both markets are overwhelmed by the volume of information presented by default, leading to increased cognitive load and a need to mentally filter for relevance. This impedes rapid clinical decision-making and is especially problematic during consultations.
- Notes on normalization: "charge_cognitive" (FR) and "carico_cognitivo" (IT) grouped as "Cognitive Load / Information Overload".

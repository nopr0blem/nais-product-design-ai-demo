# Insight Analysis (Context-aware)

## 1) Executive Summary

- Patient summary visibility is a high-severity, cross-country issue, with 5 signals indicating clinicians in both France and Italy struggle to quickly access key patient information (sig_2026_02_03_001, sig_2026_02_03_002, sig_2026_02_03_101, sig_2026_02_03_102, sig_2026_02_04_001).
- Pediatric data prominence is a critical gap in Libellia FR, with 4 high-severity signals highlighting insufficient prioritization of growth and development data (sig_2026_02_03_005, sig_2026_02_03_006, sig_2026_02_04_003).
- Cognitive load remains a medium-severity concern for Libellia FR users, with 2 signals pointing to information overload during consultations (sig_2026_02_03_003, sig_2026_02_04_002).
- Patient view adaptation and consultation workflow guidance are emerging cross-product needs, each with 2 medium-severity signals, suggesting both platforms require more context-aware and guided workflows (sig_2026_02_03_201, sig_2026_02_03_202; sig_2026_02_04_013, sig_2026_02_04_014).
- Vaccination visibility and clinical prioritization are notable but secondary issues in Libellia FR, with medium-severity signals indicating room for improvement in surfacing critical pediatric information (sig_2026_02_03_007, sig_2026_02_04_004, sig_2026_02_03_004).

### 1. Patient Summary Visibility

- **Products:** Libellia, Studio
- **Count:** 5
- **Severity (max):** high
- **Evidence IDs:** sig_2026_02_03_001, sig_2026_02_03_002, sig_2026_02_03_101, sig_2026_02_03_102, sig_2026_02_04_001
- **Representative verbatims:**
  - "I can't see the main patient info at a glance."
  - "Sintesi paziente non immediata durante la visita."
- **Interpretation:** Both French and Italian users report difficulty in rapidly accessing a clear, synthesized patient summary, impacting clinical efficiency and safety. This is a platform-level issue, indicating a need for improved default summary views that surface the most critical information without requiring configuration.
- **Normalization notes:** FR 'synthese_patient' and IT 'sintesi_paziente' merged as both refer to patient summary visibility.

### 2. Pediatric Data Prominence

- **Products:** Libellia
- **Count:** 4
- **Severity (max):** high
- **Evidence IDs:** sig_2026_02_03_005, sig_2026_02_03_006, sig_2026_02_04_003
- **Representative verbatims:**
  - "Growth curve is hidden, should be central."
  - "Développement de l’enfant pas assez visible."
- **Interpretation:** Libellia FR users urgently need pediatric-specific data (growth, development) to be more prominent in the patient view. Current layouts do not reflect clinical priorities for pediatricians, leading to frustration and risk of oversight.
- **Normalization notes:** None.

### 3. Cognitive Load

- **Products:** Libellia
- **Count:** 2
- **Severity (max):** medium
- **Evidence IDs:** sig_2026_02_03_003, sig_2026_02_04_002
- **Representative verbatims:**
  - "Too much info on one screen."
  - "Je perds du temps à chercher l’essentiel."
- **Interpretation:** There is evidence that the current information density in Libellia increases cognitive load, slowing down consultations and reducing user satisfaction. This aligns with the market context of limited consultation time and the need for rapid comprehension.
- **Normalization notes:** None.

- **Representative verbatims:**
  - "Patient view should adapt to age."
  - "Vista paziente poco flessibile per

# Insight Analysis (Context-aware)

## 1) Executive Summary

- Both Libellia FR and Studio IT users report difficulty quickly understanding pediatric patient status from the synthesis view ([sig_2026_02_03_001], [sig_2026_02_03_101], [sig_2026_02_04_001], [sig_2026_02_04_006]).
- Pediatric data (growth curves, percentiles) and vaccination status are not sufficiently prioritized or visible in patient views ([sig_2026_02_03_005], [sig_2026_02_03_006], [sig_2026_02_03_007], [sig_2026_02_04_003], [sig_2026_02_04_004], [sig_2026_02_03_105], [sig_2026_02_04_008]).
- High cognitive load due to excessive or poorly prioritized information is a recurring pain point in both markets ([sig_2026_02_03_003], [sig_2026_02_03_103], [sig_2026_02_04_002], [sig_2026_02_04_007]).
- Users in both countries want clearer clinical prioritization and more visible alerts for allergies and ongoing treatments ([sig_2026_02_03_004], [sig_2026_02_03_104], [sig_2026_02_04_019], [sig_2026_02_04_020]).
- Performance and navigation issues, while less frequent, still impact consultation efficiency ([sig_2026_02_04_015], [sig_2026_02_04_016], [sig_2026_02_04_005], [sig_2026_02_04_009]).

### Full Details for Top 5 Topics

#### 1. Pediatric synthesis visibility

- Products: Both
- Count: 6
- Severity (max): high
- Evidence IDs: [sig_2026_02_03_001], [sig_2026_02_03_002], [sig_2026_02_04_001], [sig_2026_02_03_101], [sig_2026_02_04_006], [sig_2026_02_03_102]
- Representative verbatims:
    - "Je ne comprends pas en quelques secondes si l’enfant va bien ou non."
    - "Non vedo subito se il bambino ha problemi clinici rilevanti."
- Interpretation: Across both France and Italy, users (especially pediatricians) cannot immediately assess a child's health status from the synthesis/patient summary view. This impedes rapid clinical decision-making and increases cognitive effort.
- Notes on normalization: "synthese_patient" (FR) and "sintesi_paziente" (IT) grouped as "Pediatric synthesis visibility".

---

#### 2. Pediatric data prioritization

- Products: Both
- Count: 5
- Severity (max): high
- Evidence IDs: [sig_2026_02_03_005], [sig_2026_02_03_006], [sig_2026_02_04_003], [sig_2026_02_03_105], [sig_2026_02_04_008]
- Representative verbatims:
    - "Les courbes et percentiles sont présents mais pas visibles au premier coup d’œil."
    - "I vaccini non sono messi in evidenza, devo cercarli."
- Interpretation: Key pediatric data (growth curves, percentiles, vaccination status) are not immediately visible or prioritized, requiring users to scroll or search, which delays clinical assessment.
- Notes on normalization: "donnees_pediatriques" (FR) and pediatric-specific "vaccinazioni" (IT) grouped under "Pediatric data prioritization" due to overlapping user need for pediatric signal prominence.

---

#### 3. Cognitive load / information overload

- Products: Both
- Count: 5
- Severity (max): medium
- Evidence IDs: [sig_2026_02_03_003], [sig_2026_02_04_002], [sig_2026_02_03_103], [sig_2026_02_04_007], [sig_2026_02_03_201]
- Representative verbatims:
    - "Il y a trop d’informations affichées par défaut, je dois trier mentalement."
    - "Vorrei una schermata più leggera, con solo ciò che serve."
- Interpretation: Users in both markets experience cognitive overload due to excessive or poorly prioritized information, leading to mental fatigue and slower workflows.
- Notes on normalization: "charge_cognitive" (FR) and "carico_cognitivo" (IT) grouped as "Cognitive load / information overload".

---

#### 4. Clinical prioritization & alerts

- Products: Both
- Count: 5
- Severity (max): high
- Evidence IDs: [sig_2026_02_03_004], [sig_2026_02_03_104], [sig_2026_02_04_010], [sig_2026_02_04_019], [sig_2026_02_04_020]
- Representative verbatims:
    - "Je cherche surtout les alertes importantes, pas tout le reste."
    - "Servirebbero avvisi più visibili per allergie e terapie in corso."
- Interpretation: Users want clearer clinical prioritization, especially for alerts (allergies, ongoing treatments), and guided workflows to highlight essential information during consultations.
- Notes on normalization: "priorisation_clinique"/"alertes_cliniques" (FR) and "prioritizzazione_clinica"/"avvisi_clinici" (IT) grouped as "Clinical prioritization & alerts".

#### 5. Vaccination visibility

- Products: Both
- Count: 4
- Severity (max): medium
- Evidence IDs: [sig_2026_02_

# Insight Analysis (Context-aware)

## 1) Executive Summary

- Both Libellia FR and Studio IT users struggle to quickly assess pediatric patient status due to insufficiently prioritized synthesis views ([sig_2026_02_03_001], [sig_2026_02_03_101], [sig_2026_02_04_006]).
- High cognitive load is reported in both markets, with users overwhelmed by non-prioritized or excessive information ([sig_2026_02_03_003], [sig_2026_02_03_103], [sig_2026_02_04_007]).
- Pediatric-specific data (growth curves, percentiles, vaccinations) are not prominent enough, leading to inefficiencies and risk of oversight ([sig_2026_02_03_005], [sig_2026_02_03_006], [sig_2026_02_04_003], [sig_2026_02_03_007], [sig_2026_02_04_004], [sig_2026_02_03_105], [sig_2026_02_04_008]).
- Clinical prioritization (alerts, essential data) is lacking, especially during first visits, impacting safe and efficient care ([sig_2026_02_03_004], [sig_2026_02_03_104], [sig_2026_02_04_010]).
- Navigation and workflow clarity issues persist, with users in both countries desiring more guided, streamlined consultation flows ([sig_2026_02_04_013], [sig_2026_02_04_014], [sig_2026_02_04_005], [sig_2026_02_04_009]).

### Full Details for Top 5 Topics

#### 1. Pediatric synthesis view (synthese_patient / sintesi_paziente)
- Products: Both
- Count: 6
- Severity (max): high
- Evidence IDs: [sig_2026_02_03_001], [sig_2026_02_03_002], [sig_2026_02_04_001], [sig_2026_02_03_101], [sig_2026_02_04_006], [sig_2026_02_03_102]
- Representative verbatims:
    - "Je ne comprends pas en quelques secondes si l’enfant va bien ou non."
    - "Non vedo subito se il bambino ha problemi clinici rilevanti."
- Interpretation: Across both France and Italy, users cannot rapidly assess a child’s clinical status from the synthesis view. Key pediatric signals are not sufficiently prioritized or visually distinct, leading to delays and uncertainty at dossier/cartella opening.
- Notes on normalization: Merged "synthese_patient" (FR) and "sintesi_paziente" (IT) as both refer to the pediatric patient summary view.

#### 2. Pediatric data prominence (donnees_pediatriques / dati_pediatrici)
- Products: Both
- Count: 5
- Severity (max): high
- Evidence IDs: [sig_2026_02_03_005], [sig_2026_02_03_006], [sig_2026_02_04_003], [sig_2026_02_03_007], [sig_2026_02_04_004]
- Representative verbatims:
    - "Les courbes et percentiles sont présents mais pas visibles au premier coup d’œil."
    - "Les courbes de croissance devraient être visibles sans scroller."
- Interpretation: Pediatricians in both markets report that growth data and vaccination status are not immediately visible, requiring extra effort (scrolling, clicks) to access. This impedes their ability to monitor development and compliance efficiently.
- Notes on normalization: Grouped "donnees_pediatriques" (FR) and related Italian signals under a single theme for pediatric data visibility.

#### 3. Cognitive load (charge_cognitive / carico_cognitivo)
- Products: Both
- Count: 4
- Severity (max): medium
- Evidence IDs: [sig_2026_02_03_003], [sig_2026_02_04_002], [sig_2026_02_03_103], [sig_2026_02_04_007]
- Representative verbatims:
    - "Il y a trop d’informations affichées par défaut, je dois trier mentalement."
    - "Vorrei una schermata più leggera, con solo ciò che serve."
- Interpretation: Both French and Italian users feel overwhelmed by the volume of information presented by default. They desire a more focused, less cluttered interface that reduces the need for mental filtering.
- Notes on normalization: "charge_cognitive" (FR) and "carico_cognitivo" (IT) are treated as the same underlying topic.

#### 4. Clinical prioritization (priorisation_clinique / prioritizzazione_clinica)
- Products: Both
- Count: 4
- Severity (max): high
- Evidence IDs: [sig_2026_02_03_004], [sig_2026_02_03_104], [sig_2026_02_04_010], [sig_2026_02_04_019]
- Representative verbatims:
    - "Je cherche surtout les alertes importantes, pas tout le reste."
    - "Durante la prima visita non emergono le priorità cliniche."
- Interpretation: Users in both markets struggle to identify clinical priorities and alerts, especially during first visits. There is a clear need for more prominent display of critical information (

# Insight Analysis (Context-aware)

## 1) Executive Summary

- Both Libellia FR and Studio IT users struggle to quickly assess pediatric patient status from the synthesis view, citing lack of clarity and prioritization ([sig_2026_02_03_001], [sig_2026_02_03_101], [sig_2026_02_04_001], [sig_2026_02_04_006]).
- Pediatric-specific data (growth curves, percentiles, vaccinations) are not sufficiently prominent, leading to missed or delayed clinical insights ([sig_2026_02_03_005], [sig_2026_02_03_006], [sig_2026_02_04_003], [sig_2026_02_03_007], [sig_2026_02_04_004], [sig_2026_02_03_105], [sig_2026_02_04_008]).
- High cognitive load is reported due to excessive or poorly prioritized information, impacting consultation efficiency ([sig_2026_02_03_003], [sig_2026_02_04_002], [sig_2026_02_03_103], [sig_2026_02_04_007]).
- Users in both markets request more visible clinical alerts (allergies, ongoing treatments), which are currently hard to spot ([sig_2026_02_04_019], [sig_2026_02_04_020]).
- Workflow navigation and document retrieval are pain points, with users losing time or being unsure where to find key items ([sig_2026_02_04_005], [sig_2026_02_04_011], [sig_2026_02_04_012], [sig_2026_02_04_013], [sig_2026_02_04_014]).

### 1. Pediatric synthesis clarity

- Products: Both
- Count: 6
- Severity (max): high
- Evidence IDs: [sig_2026_02_03_001, sig_2026_02_03_002, sig_2026_02_04_001, sig_2026_02_03_101, sig_2026_02_04_006, sig_2026_02_03_102]
- Representative verbatims:
    - "Je ne comprends pas en quelques secondes si l’enfant va bien ou non."
    - "Non vedo subito se il bambino ha problemi clinici rilevanti."
- Interpretation: Both French and Italian pediatricians cannot rapidly assess a child's clinical status from the synthesis view. The current design does not surface key pediatric signals or clinical priorities, leading to uncertainty and inefficiency at dossier/cartella opening.
- Notes on normalization: Mapped synthese_patient (FR) and sintesi_paziente (IT) to "Pediatric synthesis clarity".

### 2. Pediatric data prioritization

- Products: Both
- Count: 5
- Severity (max): high
- Evidence IDs: [sig_2026_02_03_005, sig_2026_02_03_006, sig_2026_02_04_003, sig_2026_02_03_105, sig_2026_02_04_008]
- Representative verbatims:
    - "Les courbes et percentiles sont présents mais pas visibles au premier coup d’œil."
    - "I vaccini non sono messi in evidenza, devo cercarli."
- Interpretation: Growth data and vaccination status are not sufficiently prioritized or visible in the patient view, requiring users to scroll or search. This delays clinical decision-making and increases risk of oversight.
- Notes on normalization: Grouped donnees_pediatriques (FR), vaccinazioni (IT), and related signals under "Pediatric data prioritization".

### 3. Cognitive load / information overload

- Products: Both
- Count: 4
- Severity (max): medium
- Evidence IDs: [sig_2026_02_03_003, sig_2026_02_04_002, sig_2026_02_03_103, sig_2026_02_04_007]
- Representative verbatims:
    - "Il y a trop d’informations affichées par défaut, je dois trier mentalement."
    - "Vorrei una schermata più leggera, con solo ciò che serve."
- Interpretation: Users in both countries report excessive information density, requiring mental filtering and increasing cognitive load during consultations. There is a clear need for default views that reduce noise and highlight essentials.
- Notes on normalization: charge_cognitive (FR) and carico_cognitivo (IT) grouped as "Cognitive load / information overload".

### 4. Clinical alerts visibility

- Products: Both
- Count: 2
- Severity (max): medium
- Evidence IDs: [sig_2026_02_04_019, sig_2026_02_04_020]
- Representative verbatims:
    - "Je voudrais des alertes plus visibles (allergies, traitements en cours)."
    - "Servirebbero avvisi più visibili per allergie e terapie in corso."
- Interpretation: There is a cross-market need for more prominent display of clinical alerts (e.g., allergies, ongoing therapies), as current visibility is insufficient and may compromise patient safety.
- Notes on normalization: alertes_cliniques (FR) and avvisi_clinici (IT) normalized to "Clinical alerts visibility".

---

### 5. Workflow navigation & document retrieval

- Products: Both
- Count: 5
- Severity (max): medium
- Evidence IDs: [sig_2026_02_04_005, sig_2026_02_04_011, sig_2026_02_04_012, sig_2026_02_04_013, sig_2026_02_04_014]
- Representative verbatims:
    - "Je me perds entre la synthèse, la consultation et les antécédents."
    - "Dopo la visita non è chiaro dove trovare le prescrizioni salvate."
- Interpretation: Users in both markets experience confusion and inefficiency navigating between synthesis, consultation, and document retrieval. This impacts workflow speed and increases risk of missing critical information.
- Notes on normalization: Grouped navigation, workflow_consultation (FR), workflow_visita (IT), documents, and documenti under "Workflow navigation & document retrieval".
